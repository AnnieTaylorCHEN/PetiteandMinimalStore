        TAXES AND DUTIES (INTERNATIONAL)
        <br />
        On checkout, Swedish value added tax (25%) will be deducted from the
        final price. Delivery is on a DAP (Delivery At Place) basis, meaning
        that taxes and duties are NOT included in the product price. Orders may
        be subjected to local taxes and/or import duties, which are levied by
        your local customs authority. The customer making the order has full
        responsibility of making sure that they are fully informed of these
        costs.{" "}

      <h4>RETURNS AND REFUND POLICY</h4>

        1. Make sure the products are in the same condition in which they were
        delivered to you, with all identification tags, packaging and seal still
        attached. If you are unsure whether we will accept your return; please
        see the important information section underneath for a complete list of
        criteria.
